# door-controller2
A new door controller for a new space, where all the previous hardware is broken and we can't replace it.

This is a daemon to read NFC tags (Mifare Classic 1K) at the door and allow keyholders in.
It mitigates knon issues in Mifare so far as is possible.

For a detailed specifiction, see the [wiki](https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/The_Door).
